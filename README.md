# react-pocs
In this repo I will put all the POC's regarding the React learning.

## Why to use React:

1).	We built React to solve one problem: building large applications with data that changes over time.

2). Simply express how your app should look at any given point in time, and React will automatically manage 
    all UI updates when your underlying data changes.

3). When the data changes, React conceptually hits the "refresh" button, and knows to only update the  
    changed parts.    

## Basic Requirement.

1). Need to setup a server on your local (xamp, wamp etc.).

2). Basic JavaScript syntax will be enough, no need of jQuery.
